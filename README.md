# CS Course Chronicles

CS Course Chronicles is a comprehensive collection of my academic journey throughout various computer science courses during my university term. This repository serves as a central hub for organizing and sharing my course-related materials, including lecture notes, assignments, projects, and insightful writings.

Please note that most of the notes are written in Persian and some of them in English. I will state this thing in the `README.md` of each folder.
